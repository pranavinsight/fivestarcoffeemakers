<ul>Picture this: roasted coffee beans, finely ground, and then boiled into water. The result? A thick, unfiltered brew that transports you across centuries.</ul>

<ul>Imagine strolling through the streets of Switzerland or Northern Italy in the mid-20th century. There, you’d encounter caffè crema, a long espresso with a twist.</ul>
<ul>Unlike its shorter espresso counterpart, caffè crema boasts more water—180ml to 240ml, to be precise. But don’t be fooled by the name; it contains no cream or dairy.</ul>
<ul>The Gaggia Classica machine of 1948 revolutionized espresso, creating this creamy delight. Its pressure produced a velvety foam atop the espresso, earning it the name “caffè crema.”</ul>
