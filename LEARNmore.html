<h1>SafeRead= Reading & Understanding in One Stop:</h1>
<img src="ScreenShot/SafeRead.png"; length="100%"; width="100%">
<p>In case if you can't read some fonts like Brush Script or Blackadder, this is the best website. Don't go to some other website and make your computer go like a potato PC (which is screwed up with viruses). We can simply say that this is a very simple reader but it helps so much. Just Copy&Paste your text in this big box and Kaboom! the result is a very simple text to read.

<h2><u>Features:-</u><h2>
<p><u>The text box:</u>The Textbox is for Copy&Pasting the text and reading. </p>
<p><u>The Dialog Box:</u>I am sorry...This Dialog Box is actually made by AI...But anyways this gives a hyperlink so you can revisit your website when you don't know how to use it :)</p>
